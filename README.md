### Welcome to my GitHubðŸ‘‹

My name is Luke Hermann. I am currently a student at the University of Chicago majoring in both computer science and economics. I work mainly in Python, with comfort in the numpy, pandas, and pygame libraries.

Note for Prospective Employers: By University of Chicago academic honesty policy, I am able to share proof of coding competency in coursework through sharing links to private repositories upon direct request. Please send me a request for proof of competency at the following email address: lukehermann@uchicago.edu
