### Hello World!ðŸ‘‹

My name is Luke Hermann. I am currently a student at the University of Chicago majoring in both computer science and economics. I work mainly in Python, with comfort in the numpy, pandas, and pygame libraries. Right now, I am learning both the C and R programming languages.

### Note for Prospective Employers:
By University of Chicago academic honesty policy, I am able to share proof of coding competency in coursework through sharing links to private course repositories. This can be done during interview with a prospective employer, or upon direct request. Please feel free to send me a request for proof of competency at the following email address: lukehermann@uchicago.edu
